Fragments from the dark field of existence.  
This stories and poetry was written in Russian and translated into English by the author. The translation intentionally retains the original linguistic rhythm and tone. It is not “polished” for native fluency, but for stylistic authenticity.


Author’s Statement

I prefer to combine ordinary reality (sometimes with fiction) — and then mercilessly dissect it.
Out of this dissection pours a black, foul‑smelling abomination — hidden, invisible to the eye, inaudible, yet palpable, as if you inhaled the vapours of festering pus.
After that, you will want to scrape out your lungs and nasopharynx.
